Greetings! I'm [Your Name], a data enthusiast from India with a background in Mechanical Engineering. While machinery and precision have been my foundation, my heart beats for the intricate world of psychology, philosophies, and English literature.

Now, I'm embarking on an exciting journey into Data Science. Transforming from a math novice to a Python enthusiast, I'm crafting my path to become a Data Scientist. Alongside the dance of algorithms, I revel in the art of data analysis, unraveling patterns, and extracting insights that tell compelling stories.

SQL is my linguistic bridge to databases, allowing me to navigate and query with finesse. As I dive into the depths of data, I wield PowerBI to bring numbers to life, creating visual narratives that resonate.

Join me in this thrilling expedition, where the language of machines converges with the poetry of data, and every SQL query unfolds a new chapter in the story of insights.
